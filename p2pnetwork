What is P2P Network???

In the simplest terms, a peer-to-peer network is a network created whenever two or more devices (usually a computer) are connected and share resources. But what creates the main difference here is that a peer-to-peer network, unlike conventional network systems, forms an ecosystem where the computers are connected through a single server computer. It can also be seen as a network where multiple computer systems are connected through a single server that enables the transfer of files from one end to the other. 

Moreover, a peer-to-peer network also serves the role of a permanent infrastructure that can connect more than a dozen computers in a small region amidst the conventional offline environment. In addition to this, if you want to learn more about peer-to-peer networks and how they can be beneficial in the field of Blockchain, you can go for a Blockchain certification course from any certified platform.
